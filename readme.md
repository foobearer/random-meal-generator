This is [Random Meal Generator](https://github.com/shinspiegel/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Random-Meal-Generator.md) solution for the app ideas, located in the previous link.

It solves the following stories:

- [x] User can click a button that will get a random meal from an external API (see below)
- [x] The app should display: Recipe name, Ingredients, Instructions and a Picture of the meal
- [x] By clicking the button again, another meal will be generated
- [x] The app should display a YouTube Video

I used for this project [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a bundler, and I did code in typescript to learn a thing or two. It was a good project, simple, quick and I did enjoy learning the basics of typescript.
